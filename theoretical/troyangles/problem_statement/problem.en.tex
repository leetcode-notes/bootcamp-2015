\problemname{Troyangles}
Troy loves triangles. He especially likes counting triangles. He has an N-by-N grid consisting of either "." or "\#" characters. Help him count the number of triangles formed only by "\#" characters in the grid. Triangles are of the form

\begin{verbatim}
              #
        #    ###
    #, ###, #####, etc.
\end{verbatim}

More formally, a triangle of height $h$ consists of $h$ rows for some positive integer $h$. The $i$th row contains $2i-1$ "\#" characters for $i = 1,...,h$. The rows are centred above each other so that they are symmetrical about a vertical line down their middle.


\section*{Input}
The first line contains the number $N (1 \leq N \leq 2000)$ representing the size of the grid. The next $N$ lines each contain $N$ characters as described above. You can assume that for test cases worth 20\% of the marks, $N \leq 50$.

\section*{Output}
Output the number of triangles in the grid.
