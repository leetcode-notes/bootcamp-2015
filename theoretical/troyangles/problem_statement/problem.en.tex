\problemname{Troyangles}
Troy loves triangles. He especially likes counting triangles. He has an $N \times N$ grid consisting
of either "." or "\#" characters. Help him count the number of triangles formed only by "\#"
characters in the grid. Triangles are of the form
\begin{verbatim}
              #
        #    ###
    #, ###, #####, etc.
\end{verbatim}

More formally, a triangle of height $h$ consists of $h$ rows for some positive integer $h$. The $i$th row contains $2i-1$ "\#" characters for $i = 1,...,h$. The rows are centred above each other so that they are symmetrical about a vertical line down their middle.


\section*{Input}
The first line contains the number $N$ $(1 \leq N \leq 2000)$ representing the size of the grid. The
next $N$ lines each contain $N$ characters as described above. For partial credit, you can assume that
$N \leq 200$. For less credit, you can assume that $N \leq 40$.

\section*{Output}
Output the number of triangles in the grid.
