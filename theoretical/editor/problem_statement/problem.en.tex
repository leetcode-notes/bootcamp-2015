\problemname{Editor Distance}
You are using an editor to type in a program that you hope solves another problem on this contest.
Instead of thinking about solving this problem, you look at your editor and start to think of how to
edit your program more quickly.

Your editor has the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item you can move your cursor using the direction keys: up ($\uparrow$), down ($\downarrow$),
  left ($\leftarrow$) or right ($\rightarrow$).

  \item pressing $\rightarrow$ will move the cursor one character to the right; if the cursor is on
  the rightmost character of a line, the cursor will move to the first character of the next line
  below the current line; (the cursor will not move if it is in the bottom-right position)

  \item pressing $\leftarrow$ will move the cursor one character to the left; if the cursor is on
  the leftmost character of a line, the cursor will move to the last character of the previous
  line above the current line; (the cursor will not move if it is in the top-left position)

  \item pressing $\uparrow$ will move the cursor to the character immediately above it; if there is
  no character immediately above the cursor, it will move to the last character of the previous
  line above the current line; (the cursor will not move if it is on the first line)

  \item pressing $\downarrow$ will move the cursor to the character immediately below it; if there
  is no character immediately below the cursor, it will move to the last character of the next
  line below the current line; (the cursor will not move if it is on the last line)
\end{itemize}

You would like to find the least number of key presses that will cause you to move between positions in your editor in a given program which you are editing.

\section*{Input}
The first line of input is $N$, the number of lines of your program $(1 \leq N \leq 100\,000)$. The
next $N$ lines contain the number of characters on each line; you can assume there is at least one
character per line, and at most $100\,000$ characters per line. The next line contains two integers
``$R_S$ $C_S$'', indicating the starting row and column of the cursor $(1 \leq R_S \leq N$, $1 \leq
C_S$, and $C_S$ is at most the number of characters in row $R_S$). The last line contains two integers
``$R_F$ $C_F$'', indicating the finishing row and column of the cursor $(1 \leq R_F \leq N$, $1
\leq C_F$, and $C_F$ is at most the number of characters in row $R_F$).

For partial credit, you may assume that there are at most $80$ characters per line.

\section*{Output}
Output the minimum number of key presses that are required to move the cursor from row $R_S$ and
column $C_S$ to row $R_F$ and column $C_F$.
