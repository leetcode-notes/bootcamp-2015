\problemname{Rebel Die}

The rebel die needs to escape from the board prison. To accomplish the
escape it needs to blend in with the board on its way. Unfortunately,
the guards colored the board using various colors and figuring out the
correct camouflage seems very difficult. The die is trying to get from
the top-left corner square to the bottom-right corner
square. Fortunately, its sides are of the same size as the squares of
the grid and each grid square is colored by a single color. The die
wants to color its sides to blend in. The only moves it can do is to
flip (along an edge) onto one of the neighboring squares (for most
squares there are four neighboring squares). To go unnoticed the top
color of the die must always match the color of the square on which it
is (in particular, in the starting position the top color of the die
must match the color of the top-left corner square and in the final
position the top color of the die must match the color of the
bottom-right corner square). The die cannot do any other moves (for
example, it cannot rotate on a square). Please help the die to figure
out if a good camouflage exists.

  \caption{For the first sample input, the coloring for the rebel die
    is shown below on a cube net. This is the only camouflage that
    allows the die to get from the top-left corner to the bottom-right
    corner and there is only one way how to do so.}

\section*{Input}

The first line contains $k$, the number of boards. Each board is
described on several lines.  The first line contains two integers $m$
(the height of the board) and $n$ (the width of the board). Then $m$ lines
follow. Each of the $m$ lines contains $n$ integers. Each integer encodes
a color. Assume that $1 \leq m, n \leq 100$ and the colors are integers from
$\{0, 1, \ldots, 29\}$.

\section*{Output}

The output contains one line for each board. The line for a board
contains ``\verb+YES+'' if there exists a coloring of the die that allows the
die to flip from the top-left corner square (the square in first
column of the first row) to the bottom-right corner square (the square
in the last column of the last row) on that board. If such a coloring
does not exist then the line contains ``\verb+NO+''.
